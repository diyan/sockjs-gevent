This is a slightly modified version of the sockjs-protocol test
suite.

The Makefile has been modified to use arbitrary virtualenvs and
hook into virtualenevwrapper if you use it.

The suite uses Nose, logs urls on failure, and drops into pdb if
the tests fail. Just simple stuff to make debuggin easier.
